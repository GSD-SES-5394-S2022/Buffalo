# Buffalo

The purpose of this report, as a learning exercise for a transportation forecasting class, is to study the possible ramifications of the removal of an urban expressway section in the city of Buffalo, NY. 

It tabulates and visualizes various tract and region level data such as employment characteristics, household size and wealth, commute times and vehicle ownership to understand the context surrounding the expressway and to create a baseline to better understand and model how the roadway changes could impact the metropolitan region as a whole.

The existing conditions data is stored in the 'existing/data' folder, while the geojson information is kept in the 'zones' folder. 

All data gathering and visualization is written in the Assignment 2 R markdown file.
